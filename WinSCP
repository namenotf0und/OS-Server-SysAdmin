Let me introduce this apps first. what is Winscp actually? WinSCP is an open source free SFTP client, FTP client, WebDAV client,
S3 client and SCP client and file manager for Windows.
Its main function is file transfer between a local and a remote computer.
Beyond this, WinSCP offers scripting and basic file manager functionality.
