# FINAL PROJECT OS SERVER & SYSADMIN
Before you read this page, im so sorry cuz im using english language to describe my final project. so take the note and read slowly.
i want to introduce my final project web server first.
what is web server?

A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. 
The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users. 
Besides HTTP, web servers also support SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol), used for email, file transfer and storage.

So What is needed to create a web server?:
1. OS Debian Server
2. Web Server Apache2
3. Webmin Server Management
4. WinSCP
5. SSH Server
